# Child Safety Standards Compliance for Substitution App

The Substitution app provides a user interface for accessing Matrix servers. It is important to understand that Substitution itself does not host or store any user data. Instead, it acts as a client, connecting users to their chosen Matrix servers.

Users have the freedom to select any Matrix server they prefer. These servers are independently operated and offer their own data management and deletion mechanisms. The robust security standards of the Matrix protocol ensure that all communication and data transmission are end-to-end encrypted. Depending on the configuration of the chosen Matrix server, data can be configured to be automatically deleted after a certain period or upon user request.

Substitution, as an application, is committed to maintaining a safe environment for all users. While the app facilitates access to external servers, we want to explicitly state that our own servers and systems will never knowingly permit the storage or transmission of illegal content, including any material that is harmful to children. We strongly encourage all users to familiarize themselves with the child safety policies and terms of service of the Matrix server they choose to use. We also provide an in-app feedback mechanism for users to report any concerns.

We believe this approach, leveraging the decentralized and secure nature of the Matrix protocol, provides a strong foundation for user privacy and safety. We are committed to complying with all applicable child safety laws and regulations and will continue to monitor and update our practices as needed. For any child safety related inquiries, please contact us through Github or the developer mail adress in the App Store you downloaded substitution from.
